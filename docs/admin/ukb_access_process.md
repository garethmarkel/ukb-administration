# The UK Biobank Access process

There are 5 stages that must take place before you can access the UK Biobank Resource:

1. **Registration:** To confirm the identity of each researcher intending to use the Resource, to check their bona fides before registering them as a potential user.

2. **Application:** To allow UK Biobank to assess: (i) whether the proposed research is likely to be approved; (ii) whether the proposed research meets the required criteria for access (including legal and ethics standards); (iii) whether the Resource contains the data and/or samples required for theproposed research; (iv) whether the amount of depletable sample required is scientifically justified; (vi) the cost of providing such data and/or samples.

3. **Access Sub-Committee (ASC) review:** The ASC is a sub-committee of the UK Biobank Board, and is responsible for making key access decisions, notably those regarding the use of depletable samples, recontactor potentially contentious research. The ASC meets on a quarterly basis.

4. **Material Transfer Agreement (MTA):** For approved applications, the MTA needs to be executed and access charges paid beforere lease of data and/or samples to the Applicant Principal Investigator (PI).

5. **Sample / Data Release:** Materials will only be released after payment and execution of the MTA. Data is typically released on a weekly basis, whereas samples are released to an agreed timetable.

We encourage you to read the [UK Biobank Access Management System User Guide](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Access_019-Access-Management-System-User-Guide-V4.0.pdf) for detailed information on getting started with the UK Biobank resource. 

The following figure shows the stages in the application and review process (with  the indicative timelines in parentheses).
