# New Researcher
Researchers who have not registered to use the UK Biobank resource can register in the [Access Management System.](https://bbams.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ams/)

You will be expected to provide the following information to the UK biobank:

1. Your name, address, email and direct telephone number
2. Your curriculum vitae
3. A list of your peer-reviewed publications (with hyperlinks to the papers whenever possible)
4. Details of any complaints against you within the previous 3 years
5. The research department, address, telephone and web site for your institution

UK Biobank Coordinating Centre staff will review the identity and the bona fides of the researcher. If the registration is approved, the researcher will be issued with a unique identifying number (indicating that they are an approved researcher) which should be used for any subsequent application. 

The researcher can then choose to make an application (see following section) and/or be named as a collaborator on an existing application. 
If the researcher has been named as a collaborator on an application to access the UK Biobank resource, they will need to log back in to the Access Management System and accept the invitation that will be visible on the researcher's Home Page.
